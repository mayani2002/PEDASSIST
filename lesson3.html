                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Constant stress drains precious energy the brain needs: in childhood, for healthy development; and in adulthood. In the areas of the brain dedicated to learning and reasoning, the
                    neural connections that comprise of brain architecture become weaker and fewer in number (because of stress ).
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, people who have experienced serious early adversity, chronic personal discrimination, or inter-generational trauma are more likely to perceive and focus attention on
                    potential threats throughout life. Frequently experiencing circumstances that seem beyond our control can also lower our sense of self-efficacy (the belief that we can do things to make change and improve our own lives), which is key
                    to our ability to plan and engage in goal-oriented behaviors.
